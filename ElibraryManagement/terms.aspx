<h2> Standard Terms and Conditions of Licence and Use for the V&R e-Library of the Publishers</h2>
<hr />
<img id="terms" src="imgs/terms.jpg" />
<p>
A terms and conditions agreement outlines the website administrator’s rules regarding user behavior and provides information about the actions the website administrator can and will perform.

Essentially, your terms and conditions text is a contract between your website and its users. In the event of a legal dispute, arbitrators will look at it to determine whether each party acted within their rights.

Creating the best terms and conditions page possible will protect your business from the following:

Abusive users: Terms and Conditions agreements allow you to establish what constitutes appropriate activity on your site or app, empowering you to remove abusive users and content that violates your guidelines.
Intellectual property theft: Asserting your claim to the creative assets of your site in your terms and conditions will prevent ownership disputes and copyright infringement.
Potential litigation: If a user lodges a legal complaint against your business, showing that they were presented with clear terms and conditions before they used your site will help you immensely in court.
In short, terms and conditions give you control over your site and legal enforcement if users try to take advantage of your operations.</p>

<b>1. Object and exercise of the right of use:</b>

1.1    The Licensee receives the non-exclusive, non-transferable and non- sub-licensable right to use eBooks and eJournals of the V&R eLibrary for the contractually agreed period and to access the respectively agreed contents on www.vr-elibrary.de. Access and use take place via an independent network or via a virtual Internet network.

1.2    The Licensee undertakes only to permit authorised users access and use, and to ensure use in accordance with the contractual terms through appropriate safeguards. Authorised users within the meaning of these Standard Terms and Conditions of Licence are:

employees of the Licensee
teaching staff and research assistants and lecturers of the Licensee
enrolled students of an institution of the Licensee
library users within the premises of the library (walk-in users)
registered remote-access users</p>
<p>
<b>2. Copyright; Access arrangements:</b>

2.1 The V&R eLibrary www.vr-elibrary.de and its contents, layouts and operation concept are protected by copyright. The Licensee shall take all appropriate security measures in order to prevent misuse, in particular to prevent mass downloads and the unlawful dissemination of the contents.

2.2 For the purpose of access to the V&R eLibrary, an authentication of the IP address or IP address range of the Licensee will be carried out. The Licensee can also log in using a username and password, in addition to having access through a secure remote-access authentification process such as Shibboleth or a VPN login provided by one´s institution.

2.3 Library users, including so-called walk-in users, are only permitted access and use within the premises of the Licensee at computer workstations made available there.

2.4. Authorised users may access the V&R eLibrary and contents using 'remote access' provided a safe network
for research purposes and for personal use, print out individual articles or small parts of a work or make electronic copies (within the meaning of § 53 Urheberrechtsgesetz – Copyright Act);
in order to provide so-called 'readers'’ (seminar materials), use parts (within the meaning of § 53 Urheberrechtsgesetz) of an eJournal or an eBook in printed or electronic form. In this connection, the Licensee shall ensure that only persons who are authorised users and also participants of the respective course receive access to these readers.

2.5 Commercial exploitation of the object of the Licence, such as the re-sale, sub-licensing or inclusion of the licensed contents in document delivery services, is not permitted. On the other hand, non-commercial inter-library loans are admissible between libraries within the same country in respect of individual magazine articles or chapters of books in so far as these are created and sent exclusively in paper form. For this purpose, the use of special software is also admissible (such as e.g. Ariel Interlibrary Loan Software from Infotrieve).

2.6 The Licensee and the Licensee´s entitled users shall not publish or distribute any contents covered by this license, whether in part or whole, on the Internet.

2.7 Programmes which are designed to retrieve data on a continuous and automated basis or to carry out downloads systematically (crawlers, robots, spiders and suchlike) may not be used by the Licensee or the authorised users.

2.8 The contents of the object of the Licence will be provided exclusively via the V&R eLibrary www.vr-elibrary.de. The temporary intermediate storage (caching) of the object of the Licence or of parts of the object of the Licence is permitted in so far as technically necessary. The archiving of the object of the Licence or of parts of the object of the Licence by the Licensee and the making of the same available to authorised users is only permitted with the prior written consent of the Licensor. In respect of the archiving of such contents, the terms and conditions for access to www.vr-elibrary.de apply correspondingly.

2.9 As part of the license to the contents, the Licensee shall receive a corresponding list containing information about any use that may potentially be restricted in time, the acceptable number of simultaneously logins and any fees that may accrue in the scope of the licensing model/publication offer.
<img id="tandc" src="imgs/t&c.jpg" />
2.10 The licensor may provide the licensee with free access to contents not contained in this agreement (e.g., older issues of journals) above and beyond the agreed-upon amount. This is done as an act of goodwill and may be revoked by the Licensor at any time. These additional rights of use automatically terminate at the end of the licensing period.

2.11 The licensor reserves the right at any time to withdraw parts of the licensed property, if it turns out later that they have not or no longer appropriate rights or that third party rights or laws are violated. In such cases the licensee shall be notified by the licensor in due time. If the retracted content represent more than just a marginal share (e.g. individual illustrations) of the total product, the Licensee will be refunded pro rata share costs, unless the useful life of the retracted content was less than twelve months.

2.12 The Licensee may neither remove, alter nor suppress any references to copyrights, any logos, brand names, identification features, references to liability or exclusions of liability, rights reserved or names of authors or editors in the licensed contents and programmes.

2.13 The authorised users are to be informed of these Terms and Conditions of Licence by the Licensee and placed under an obligation to observe copyrights and the Terms and Conditions of Licence. Upon request, the Licensee shall produce proof of compliance with this duty.</p>

<p>
<b>3. Conclusion of the contract; Right of cancellation:</b>

3.1 A contract is formed when the order of the Licensee has been confirmed by the licensor; the online offers on www.vr-elibrary.de do not of themselves constitute any binding offer of contract. The activation of the IP of the Licensee and the corresponding notification by e-mail or the sending of the invoice also represent confirmation.

3.2 The Licensor reserves the right to change or adapt these terms of use as necessary. The Licensee shall be notified of any such changes by the publisher or one of the publisher´s sales partners via e-mail or in writing. In cases involving major changes to the rights of use, the Licensee shall have the right to terminate for cause in writing the existing agreement within two weeks´ time after receiving notification concerning the changes to the terms of use. Such termination for cause shall be become effective at the time at which the announced changes to the terms of use are implemented.</p>

<p>
<b>4. Technical facilities; Online availability; Security:</b>

4.1 The licensor provides servers and lines in adequate capacity and bandwidth, equivalent to the offers of comparable providers. The interconnection point is the connection of the servers of the Licensor to the Internet. Any liability for transmission congestion in the Internet (e.g. in the case of problems with transatlantic cables) is excluded.

4.2 Occasional maintenance works, including in individual cases server shutdowns or restarts, which may be necessary for the smooth functioning of the eLibrary may in rare cases lead to temporary limitations in service which shall not constitute grounds for complaint.

4.3 The Licensor shall ensure adequate security in respect of its offers, in particular against hacker attacks and viruses. The Licensee shall likewise be obliged to ensure adequate security; in particular, the Licensee must take all appropriate measures in order to preclude any unauthorised access or the unauthorised dissemination of the contents governed by the contract.

4.4 The Licensee undertakes to provide full and correct particulars when placing an order and when registering (e.g. number of the possible authorised users, safeguards, IP range). The Licensee shall treat the access data confidentially and inform the Licensor immediately in the event of any loss of data, of any case where the rights granted have been exceeded or in the event of any misuse. The Licensor shall not be liable for any damage suffered by the Licensee through the misuse of its access data.

4.5 For the avoidance of misuse, the Licensor shall be entitled to monitor the access to the object of the Licence and the use of the V&R eLibrary and, in the case of proven misuse, to block the access. The Licensor shall notify the Licensee without delay and set a reasonable period for the elimination of the misuse.

4.6 The licensor shall provide for access to user statistics in standardized formats (e.g., COUNTER).

4.7 The Licensee shall indemnify the Licensor from all damage arising from any use in contravention of the contractual provisions.</p>

<p>
<b>5. Price adjustments, Warranty; Liability:</b>

5.1 The Licensee will be informed in writing or by e-mail of any price adjustment. In the case of price increases, the Licensee may terminate the Licence Agreement within two weeks following receipt of the corresponding notification. For this purpose, the written form (letter or e-mail) is necessary.

5.2 A right of termination on the part of the Licensee on account of malfunctions or limitations in service shall only arise where the disruption is considerable and is also not eliminated within a reasonable period. The Licensee shall likewise have no claim to the elimination of insignificant flaws.

5.3 The Licensor shall only be liable to pay damages in the case of deliberate intent or gross negligence. In all other respects, the statutory provisions apply.</p>

<p>
<b>6. Term and termination of the contract; Access following the end of the contract:</b>

6.1 The Licence Agreement runs for the contractually agreed period. In so far as applicable for licensed contents (e.g. in the case of journals), this period will be extended in each case by a further 12 months unless terminated with notice of 8 weeks, to expire at the end of the contractual term.
Where access unrestricted in terms of time has been agreed in relation to certain contents (e.g. eBooks), only the contents provided by the Licensor as a gesture of goodwill shall be affected by notice of termination or by non-renewal of a contract (see 2.10).

6.2 Following the end of the contract, the Licensee shall, upon request, be granted the right to receive further access to those contents governed by the contract which appeared during the term of the contract and for which it also made payment.

6.3 The right of the parties to the contract to terminate the same for cogent reasons remains unaffected. In particular, the Licensor reserves the right of extraordinary termination in the case of serious or persistent breaches in the area of access to or the passing on of data.

6.4 Any notice of termination must be given in written form. It is to be sent to:</p>
